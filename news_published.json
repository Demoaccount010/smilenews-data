This unprecedented weather event not only halted their pursuit but also rendered their remaining matches at a loss of time and resources.</p>\n<p>In an effort to prevent further delays, Indian authorities have temporarily suspended all cricket activities across the country due to poor visibility caused by recent rainstorms.
