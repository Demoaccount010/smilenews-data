  "content": "<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>As the brutal winter storm known as \"Snowmageddon\" continues to sweep through the northeastern United States, the latest news from around the world highlights the escalating impact and urgency of the situation.

The impact on schools has also intensified; as many as 20 million students have been left without classes due to disruptions caused by the extreme weather.</p>\n<h3>Key Developments</h3>\n<p>As the storm moves eastward into New England and Canada, preparations continue for what could be a historic event. Cities are bracing themselves with evacuation orders in place for areas that may be at risk of flooding or landslides. The United States Capitol building has also ordered employees to work from home amid concerns over potential power outages due to the severe weather.</p>\n<p>In Europe, the \"bomb cyclone\" continues its impact across parts of Scandinavia and Germany, prompting a travel ban in Norway and Sweden.
